   Please follow strictly the guidance in CMakelists.txt.

   Package Version:
   LIBWBXML_VERSION_MAJOR
   LIBWBXML_VERSION_MINOR
   LIBWBXML_VERSION_PATCH

   Library Version:
   LIBWBXML_LIBVERSION_CURRENT 
   LIBWBXML_LIBVERSION_REVISION

(3) Test the source code

   Run "make test" again several times to try to see race conditions.
