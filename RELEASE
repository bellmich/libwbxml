Making a release
================

To make a release of libwbxml, do the following:

 - check out a fresh copy from github

 - increment the version numbers in ./CMakeLists.txt: 

   Package Version:
   LIBWBXML_VERSION_MAJOR
   LIBWBXML_VERSION_MINOR
   LIBWBXML_VERSION_PATCH

   Library Version:
   LIBWBXML_LIBVERSION_AGE 
    * Increment if any interface changed since last release.

   LIBWBXML_LIBVERSION_REVISION
    * Increment if any library code changed since last release.
      Set to 0 if any interface  has been changed since last release.

   LIBWBXML_LIBVERSION_AGE
    * Reset to 0 if any interface has been removed since last release.
      If any interface has been added then increment.

 - Run "make test" again several times to try to see race conditions.
   "cmake . -B/tmp/build/libwbxml"
   "cd /tmp/build/libwbxml"
   "make"
   "make test"

 - Check ChangeLog to be complete and add the new release name.

 - Final steps with git:
   git pull origin
   git pull upstream master
   git status
   git commit -a
   git push
   git tag libwbxml-$MAJOR.$MINOR.$PATCH
   git push origin libwbxml-$MAJOR.$MINOR.$PATCH

 - if someone else made changes and the push fails,
   you have to "git pull" and run the tests again

 - please run "git status" before you continue to be 100 percent sure
   that there is no forgotten commit and no unrevisioned file.

 - Once the commit succeeds, you have to create a new release on GitHub.
   Please create a pull request from your fork.
   Please use the web GUI of Github and write some useful release notes.
